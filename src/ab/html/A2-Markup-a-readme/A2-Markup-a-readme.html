    <h1>React.</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Declarative:</strong>React makes it painless to create
        interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application,
        and React will efficiently update and render just the right components
        when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more
        predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Component-Based:</strong>Build encapsulated components that
        manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since
        component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can
        easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the
        DOM.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lern Once,Write Anywhere:</strong> We don't make assumptions
        about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features
        in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the
        server using Node and power mobile apps using
        <strong>React Native</strong>.

    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can
      use as little or as much React as you need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use <strong>e Online Playgrounds </strong>to get a taste of React.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add React to a Website </strong>as a script tag in one minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Create a New React App </strong>if you're looking for a powerful
        JavaScript toolchain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can use React as a script tag from a
      <strong>CDN,</strong>or as a react package on <strong>npm.</strong>
    </p>
    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>You can find the React documentation <strong>on the website.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Check out the<strong> Getting Started</strong>page for a quick overview.
    </p>
    <p>The documentation is divided into several sections:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tutorial</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Main Concepts</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Guides</strong></li>
      <li><strong>API Reference</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Where to Get Support</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Contributing Guide</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We have several examples <strong>on the website.</strong> Here is the
      first one to get you started:
    </p>
    <p>This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.</p>
    <p>
      You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not
      required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it
      feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a script tag, read this
      section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended JavaScript
      toolchains handle it automatically
    </p>
