    <h1>React</h1>
    <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design
        simple views for each state in your appulcation, and React will
        efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
        changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to
        understand, and easier to debug.
      </li>
      <li>
        Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own
        state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is
        written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich
        data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of
        your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without
        rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node
        and power mobile apps using React Native.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learn how to use React in your project.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
      React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can
      use as little or as much React as you need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Online Playgrounds to get a taste of React.</li>
      <li>Add React to a Website as a &lt;script&gt; tag in one minute.</li>
      <li>
        Create a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript
        toolchain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      You can find the React documentation on the website. <br />
      Check out the Getting Started page for a quick overview. <br />
      The documentation is divided into several sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tutorial</li>
      <li>Main Concepts</li>
      <li>Advanced Guides</li>
      <li>API Reference</li>
      <li>Where to Get Support</li>
      <li>Contribuiting Guide</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
      We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you
      started:
    </p>
    <p>
      import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"; function HelloMessage({
      name }) { return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;; } const root =
      createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));
      root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name="Taylor" /&gt;);
    </p>
    <p>This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.</p>
    <p>
      You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not
      required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it
      feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a &lt;script&gt; tag,
      read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended
      JavaScript toolchains handle it automatically.
    </p>
